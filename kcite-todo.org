Currently need to work on build_biblography, then 
uncomment all the other resolve methods other than pubmed id.

Working on timeout/failed to resolve message in javascript

* Citeproc [0/1]
 - [ ] Have citeproc working properly now outside of kcite
 - [ ] Need to move loading of scripts to wp_enqueue script like done in
   mathjax
 - [ ] Have the JSON bibliography. Now need to load the damn thing. 

* Short code handling of in text citations [6/6]
  - [X] Define minimal citation object class
    - containing type and identifier.   
    - Needs to support an is equals.
  - [X] Add bibliography object to hold these in order. 
    - Uniquify on input, 
    - return article unique anchor
  - [X] Rewrite to use citation and bib object
    - get_cites, process_refs, and related functions 
  - [X] add short code handler
  - [X] Rewrite get_cites to return just the bibliography
    - kill regexp stuff
  - [X] Rewrite process refs to remove regexp replace stuff. 
        

* Move to cross ref JSON [0/5]
 - [ ] citiation_to_citeproc needs to data transform only non JSON
       resources
 - [ ] crossref JSON will have to be decoded, then re-encoded, as we can't use
       it raw. We have to manipulate it minimally at top level. 
 - [ ] Citation object $json needs to be PHP array and NOT JSON. 
 - [ ] get_crossref_metadata becomes really easy -- leave it as a place for fixes
 - [ ] crossref_doi_lookup becomes content negotiated. 

* Location of bib [3/5]
  - [X] rewrite filter with generic function
  - [ ] write shortcode handler for [bibliography]
  - [X] write filter
  - [X] plug both of these into generic function
  - [ ] Add services panel option to switch of filter
        
* Refactoring [3/7]
 - [X] Clarify specification of "metadata"
 - [X] Add this to citation? Certainly refactor it out.
 - [ ] Write resolver class
 - [ ] Move pubmed and DOI resolver to resolver class
 - [ ] Write renderer class
 - [ ] author and date need to be classes, rather than arrays      
 - [X] metadata_to_json needs to go into Citation
 - [ ] XML parsing should be portable trivially to xpath
 - [ ] Move rest of JSON to variable interpolated
       
** Remove "metadata array" [6/8]
 - [ ] refactor get_arrays() to return error for antyhing not noted
 - [X] metadata to JSON
 - [X] crossref_doi_lookup
 - [X] pubmed_doi_lookup
 - [X] array_from_xml
 - [X] get_pubmed_metadata
 - [X] get_crossref_metadata
 - [ ] renderer operates over JSON. This doesn't appear to achieve anything
       

* Hardening [0/4]
 - [ ] Bib should not be formatted with OL to ensure anchor numbers stay in
   sync
 - [ ] Handle unknown citation type
 - [ ] Error message for no resolving identifier
 - [ ] Handle dois of form doi:

* Transients
 - [ ] Consider where to add transients support
 - [ ] Add debug configurability 
 - [ ] Add transients support       

* Cito Support [/]
  Want to add the ability to surround in text citation with cito style links.
 - [ ] define output format
 - [ ] stuff this into citation

* pubmed resolver [/]
  - [ ] Link to pubmed link out if possible

* URL resolver [0/3]
  - [ ] Put in initial support for URL, just added to bibliography
  - [ ] Look at metadata Simon is putting in
  - [ ] Initially, grab kblog metadata

* Bugs

get pmedid is always returning 0 for the dates. 

This is still happening -- it looks like the entrez stuff coming back has
changed. Need to rewrite the parser into Xpath. 

However, faking it still hasn;t made the damn thing work correctly.
