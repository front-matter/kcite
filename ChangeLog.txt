This version introduces client side rendering using citeproc.js. This has been
set as the default. It is possible to use server-side rendering but this has
been less extensively checked. Author-year style citation is used; currently,
changing this requires (minor) code changes. Later versions will make this
optional. 

Timeouts are now configurable. The default value of 5 is reasonable for most 
articles to retrieve all their bibliographic metadata. The data is cached, so
subsequent reloads will retrieve more. 

There have been many code cleanups.
