===

This version introduces client side rendering using citeproc.js. This has been
set as the default. It is possible to use server-side rendering but this has
been less extensively checked. Author-year style citation is used; currently,
changing this requires (minor) code changes. Later versions will make this
optional. 

Timeouts are now configurable. The default value of 5 is reasonable for most 
articles to retrieve all their bibliographic metadata. The data is cached, so
subsequent reloads will retrieve more. 

There have been many code cleanups. 

KCite is now released under GPL v3.0. This is as a result of the introduction
of citeproc-js which were are using under the terms of the Affero GPL, which
is incompatible with v2.0.
